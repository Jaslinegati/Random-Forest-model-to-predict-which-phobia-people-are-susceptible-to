# Phobia-Analysis

This is an analysis of phobias based on different 
lifestyle features such as age , gender, loneliness, level of happiess, internet usage, are they an only child ...
I then went on to create a random forest model to try predict whether someone is susceptible to two phobias( 
snakes or dangerous dogs) based on their lifestyle features.
